### 👋 Hi, I am Ritesh Sinha 

A JS enthusiast who always ♥️love to learn. 

By degree I am Computer Science engineer, by profession I am developer and by passion I am an atrist. The thoughest ❓question to answer is, what is my hobby. In free time I love to 😴sleep. Not sure how many people buy that as a hobby😆. 

Currently I work with **[Idyllic](https://idyllic.co/)** as a front end developer 👨‍💻.

I code in JavaScript. I have tried out Python 😁.

Blindly in love with React and React Native.

Now I am learning Advanced JS 🖖.

Really 🤯crazy about micro-frontends, graphql, project architecturing and deno.
